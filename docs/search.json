In addition to the open data portal, historical weather patterns and city events should be included in a larger analysis. Given the size and scope or the larger project, deconstruction into various sections is the most efficient way to define and answer the questions.\nAt a minimum, the stakeholders would want to know:\n\nWhat is the relationship between Divvy Ridership and congestion patterns in Chicago?\nWhat additional areas of research need to be included in the final analysis of Divvy’s impact on congestion."

The data cleaning process that created these data sets is detailed in the [Making Simple Features] section of this document.\n\n\nCongestion Zones\n\n\n [1] \"time\"        \"region_id\"   \"speed\"       \"region\"      \"bus_count\"  \n [6] \"num_reads\"   \"hour\"        \"day_of_week\" \"month\"       \"description\"\n[11] \"record_id\"   \"west\"        \"east\"        \"south\"       \"north\"      \n[16] \"nw_location\" \"se_location\" \"start_year\" \n\n\nThe congestion zone data also contains regions where speed, time, and bus counts are measured - a total of 2,534,656 from 2018-03-09 to 2019-12-31. How this data was transformed into GIS features are documented in the Process section of this document."
