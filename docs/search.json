In addition to the open data portal, historical weather patterns and city events should be included in a larger analysis. Given the size and scope or the larger project, deconstruction into various sections is the most efficient way to define and answer the questions.\nAt a minimum, the stakeholders would want to know:\n\nWhat is the relationship between Divvy Ridership and congestion patterns in Chicago?\nWhat additional areas of research need to be included in the final analysis of Divvy’s impact on congestion."

While other names correspond, roughly, to the neighborhoods covered by the zone, Downtown-Lakefront does not. Nor does Rogers - Park-West Ridge or Hyde Park - Kenwood - Woodlawn. The metadata of this data set does not explain this clearly, and before this is presented as fact, work to verify these shapes should be completed. These concerns aside, the take away is clear: There are neighborhoods in Chicago that do not have a Divvy station.\nThe method used to show Divvy Stations per zone can also be used to show where most trips start and where they end.\n\n\nWhere do the Morning Rush Trips Start\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nmorning_rush_from_sf &lt;- morning_rush %&gt;%\n  select(from_station_id, from_station_name, from_latitude, from_longitude) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(from_longitude)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"from_longitude\", \"from_latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\nmorning_rush_from_counts &lt;- congestion_regions %&gt;%\n  mutate(counts = lengths(st_intersects(congestion_regions$box, \n                                       morning_rush_from_sf$geometry)))  %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf()\n\nchicago +\n  geom_sf(data = morning_rush_from_counts,\n          aes(fill = counts)) +\n  viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +\n   geom_sf_label(data = counts,\n            aes(label = region_id),\n            size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Divvy Stations per Chicago Area Starting in A Congestion Zone\",\n         fill = \"Number of Rides\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do the Morning Rush Trips End\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nmorning_rush_to_sf &lt;- morning_rush %&gt;%\n  select(to_station_id, to_station_name, to_latitude, to_longitude) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(to_longitude)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"to_longitude\", \"to_latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\nmorning_rush_to_counts &lt;- congestion_regions %&gt;%\n  mutate(counts = lengths(st_intersects(congestion_regions$box, \n                                       morning_rush_to_sf$geometry)))  %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf()\n\nchicago +\n  geom_sf(data = morning_rush_to_counts,\n          aes(fill = counts)) +\n  viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +\n   geom_sf_label(data = counts,\n            aes(label = region_id),\n            size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Divvy Stations per Chicago Area Ending in A Congestion Zone\",\n         fill = \"Number of Rides\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do Evening Rush Rides Start\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nevening_rush_sf &lt;- evening_rush %&gt;%\n  select(from_station_id, from_station_name, from_latitude, from_longitude) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(from_longitude)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"from_longitude\", \"from_latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\nevening_rush_counts &lt;- congestion_regions %&gt;%\n  mutate(counts = lengths(st_intersects(congestion_regions$box, \n                                       evening_rush_sf$geometry)))  %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf()\n\nchicago +\n  geom_sf(data = evening_rush_counts,\n          aes(fill = counts)) +\n  viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +\n   geom_sf_label(data = counts,\n            aes(label = region_id),\n            size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Divvy Stations per Chicago Area Starting Congestion Zone\",\n         fill = \"Amount of Divvy Stations\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do the Evening Rush Trips End\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nevening_rush_to_sf &lt;- evening_rush %&gt;%\n  select(to_station_id, to_station_name,to_latitude, to_longitude) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(to_longitude)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"to_longitude\", \"to_latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\nmorning_rush_to_counts &lt;- congestion_regions %&gt;%\n  mutate(counts = lengths(st_intersects(congestion_regions$box, \n                                      evening_rush_to_sf$geometry)))  %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf()\n\nchicago +\n  geom_sf(data = morning_rush_to_counts,\n          aes(fill = counts)) +\n  viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +\n   geom_sf_label(data = counts,\n            aes(label = region_id),\n            size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Divvy Stations per Chicago Area Ending Congestion Zone\",\n         fill = \"Amount of Divvy Stations\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations show that the bulk of Divvy rides occur in Zone 15, which is Bridgeport-McKinley-Lower West, with Zone 10, Humboldt-Garfield Prk E/W being a popular morning rush start and evening rush end time. The data suggests that both Zone 10 and 15 deserve additional study for commuters. Determining the impact of divvy riders on congestion would depend on congestion numbers from those same zones."
