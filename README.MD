[This is my Google Data Analytics Capstone Project.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) This is where I look for patterns between Divvy Ridership and Congestion Patterns in Chicago. All with R and Quarto.

I've read and studied R and Data Science on my own for a long time. This cert is to show off my **bona fides.**

# Why a READ ME?
GitHubs have READMES.
